## Introduction
RainyDay is a weather app written in pure Java and styled with CSS, utilizing the RESTful 
[WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) for data. It is fully featured, easy to use, and beautifully 
designed. In addition to a full application, RainyDay also has a 
console client and API counterpart ([RainyDayConsoleClientAPI](https://github.com/ridvikpal/RainyDayConsoleClientAPI)).
This is if you want a console version of RainyDay or a Java API to use in your own code. I have extensively detailed 
the backend API design for RainyDay in that github repo, if you would like to study that.

## Goals
The goal of RainyDay was to create a great looking and functional weather application. I was inspired by the Apple's
iOS weather app and was learning Java, so I decided to create a weather app in Java! Also, I noticed there was a 
significant lack of weather apps in Java. This was a great learning opportunity for Java, JavaFX, CSS, and RESTful
APIs!
